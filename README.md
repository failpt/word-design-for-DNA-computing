# Word Design for DNA Computing on Surfaces
This is an experimental project attempting to solve [problem 033](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob033/) on [CSPLib](https://www.csplib.org/).

Given a fixed size `n`, I try to find a set of `n` strings satisfying the problem constraints. I introduce a `cnfencoder` package containing `DNAEncoder`, which  reduces the problem of finding a set of a given size to SAT (helps construct a CNF formula to feed the solver and decode the solution). In pursuit of experimentation, I use three different SAT solvers – [Glucose](https://github.com/audemard/glucose), [Kissat](https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat), and [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) ([paper](https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/BiereFallerFazekasFleuryFroleyksPollitt-CAV24.pdf)) –  and compare their performance on fixed input sizes.
